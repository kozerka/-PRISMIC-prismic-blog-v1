## Blog Powered by Prismic and React-Bootstrap

### Introduction

This blog is developed using the power of headless CMS, specifically with [Prismic](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/introduction-to-the-content-query-api) in mind. It leverages the flexibility offered by headless CMSs to create, manage, and deliver content without the need for a dedicated backend system. This makes it an excellent choice for frontend developers who wish to focus on the frontend without getting entangled with backend intricacies.
